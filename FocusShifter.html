    <p>To add in-sample offset shift to reflection autofocus systems (either home built or commercial systems such as the ASI CRISP) We developed an Arduino based controller for shifting the focus lock position of reflection based autofocus systems.</p>
 
    <img src="Images/Focus-Shifter.jpg" width="60%">

    <p>LifeHack incorporates a reflection based ASI CRISP as its primary method of maintaining focus. Similar to many other systems, it reflects an IR beam off a coverslip, and uses shifts in the position of this beam to maintain constant objective-slide separation by closed loop control. 
    The limitation of this approach is that this approach only allows for focus lock at/ very near to the coverslip, in a range &lt; 1 um for a 100x high NA objective, or optionally, to offset the lock position a fixed amount by physically displacing the autofocus device. We wanted to image cells at different heights within the same sample, so this approach was not sufficient for us.</p>
    
    <p>As the Focus Shifter module on LifeHack has its own beam path and tube lens we were able to produce large changes in the lock position by implementing a motorized Arduino controlled tube lens on this path. This effectively offsets the lock position (the coverslide) and the camera/ excitation focus by a variable amount, in our case allowing ~ 10 um of lock range on 100x NA 1.49 TIRF objective, instead of the standard &lt; 1 um with a fixed autofocus tube lens.</p>
    
    <p>Although this implementation is built around an ASI CRISP, in principle it should work for any commercial or home built autofocus system.</p>

    <p>The module can be constructed following the 3D design. The zoom lens housing should be fixed (just tape it a bit) with the lens 1 rotation away from the main body end for CRISP set up. This allows the focusing range to be biased into the sample. The set up instructions for the CRISP system can be found <a href="http://asiimaging.com/docs/crisp_manual">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Control Set Up</h2>
 
    <p> Wire the motor to the Adafruit control board in 6-wire configuration. Ensure to connect an external 12V power supply to the Arduino board to supply sufficient power to the motor.</p>

    <img src="Images/Arduino-MotorConnection.jpg" width="40%">

    <p> <a href="#Software">Code</a> is included to control the stepper motor and microscope focus via Arduino. Download the Arduino IDE, and open the Arduino focus-controller.ino sketch. Install the <b>_Adafruit\_Motor\_Shield\_V2\_Library_</b> via the <b>_Sketch\>Include Library\>Manage Libraries_</b> interface. Upload the code to the Arduino board.</p>

    <p> Connect to the Arduino board and control the motor using the Arduino (or any other) serial monitor interface. Commands are encorporated to move the motor, and hence the lens, in both directions and to a zero point. There are also commands to adjust movement limits and speed.</p>

    <p> Axial magnification is proportional to the square of the lateral magnification. In order for a tube lens shift of several mm to cause sufficient focal shift, we need to use a shorter focal length tube lens for the autofocus, compared to the imaging tube lens. In our case, the imaging tube lens is f=200mm, and the autofocus is f=100mm, reducing the axial autofocus magnification by a factor of 4 â€“ this gives us an ~10 um lock range.</p>
    
    <h3>Control Box</h3>

    <p>In practice the serial monitor control is too clunky for any more than initial tests. For regular use there is a dual throw switch to control the lens position and a home button to return to a set "zero" point. Both are contained in a 3d printed box.</p>

    <img src="Images/FocusShifterController.jpg" width="60%">

    <p>To produce this, simply solder suitable lengths of wire to the arduino ports (up=2, down=3, home=4, ground) at one end and to a 9 pin connector at the other. This is best done with the arduino and connector already seated in the box.</p>
    
    <img src="Images/Arduino.jpg" width="40%">

    <p>At the control box end, solder suitable lengths of wire to the corresponding pins on a 9 pin (DB9) connector at one end and spade crimp connectors at the other.</p>

    <p>Each connection requires a ground but the arduino only provides one. Creating a multi-ended connector, as below, solves this and contains the solder point within the control box.</p>

    <img src="Images/ground.jpg" width="40%">

    <p>The buttons and 9 pin connector can then be inserted into the control box and connected using the crimp connectors.</p>
