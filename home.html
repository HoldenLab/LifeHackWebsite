  <p>To many labs the significant time and expertise required to design and build a microscope is prohibitive. But still, a hackable, home built microscope will hold benefits that cannot be overlooked. The LifeHack microscope is an open-source system designed to provide an easily modifiable, modular platform for live cell SMLM imaging. It has been contructed from comercially available and 3D printed parts to simplify the build process while retaining adaptability.</p>

  <p>The LifeHack microscope is a fully featured system with broad capabilities as it is designed. Unlike commercial systems however, it is intended to be equally useful as a development platform from which to build specialised systems to solve cutting edge problems.</p>

  <h2 id="DesignPhilosophy">Design Philosophy</h2>
  <p>To achieve the goal of creating a system that is adaptable and future proof we have designed the microscope around 3 modules. These modules may be modified individually or used in conjuntion with other systems. The system is almost exclusively made from either commercially available components or 3D printed parts. This has been done with the aim of maximising reproducability for other labs.</p>
  <a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/fusion-360/overview"><img src="Images/Fusion360-logo.png" width="30%"></a>
  <p>The designs for the microscope have been modelled using Autodesk's Fusion 360 software. These are available as .STEP files or native .f3d files from the Git hub repository. These designs allow for users to adapt the system to suit their need and function as easy to follow plans during the build process.</p>

  <h2 id="LiveCell">Live Cell Capable</h2>
  <p>An incubator design enclosing the main body of the microscope is included as part of the system with a wide array of access hatches for both sample manipulation and microscope alignment. This not only fulfils the requirement for keeping living samples at an optimal and consistent temperature but also provides almost complete thermal stability for the microscope body.</p>

  <h2 id="Drift">Drift Correction</h2>
  <p>The Microscope is capable of providing drift correction using the ASI CRISP system approximately matching the system found on Nikon's offering. This is augmented by a translatable tube lens that extends the lock range to approximately 1mm. The LifeHack system additionally includes an infra-red camera and LED to enable brightfield imaging concurrently with fluorescence imaging. This means that image or bead based drift correction can be implemented without affecting data collection.</p>
  
  <h2 id="TIRF">Ring TIRF for Excelent Nignal to Noise</h2>
  <p>TIRF and HILO illumination are provided by the incorporated pair of Galvo-scanning mirrors. These mirrors are also capable of oscillating rapidly which allows for the beam to be scanned in circles at 100s of Hz. This enables the use of ring TIRF whereby through the course of an image the beam illuminates the coverslip from all angles reducing shadowing or artifacts caused by imperfections in the coverslip or inhomogeneities in the sample.</p>

  <h2 id="Astig">Astigmatic 3D</h2>
  <p>3D localisation is provided by a cylindrical lens positioned in a 3D printed box immediately before the camera. This contains a rail mounting system to allow for axial adjustment of the lens position. Sliding the lens towards and away from the camera will respectively reduce and increase the severity of the astigmatism at the camera. A stronger astigmatism enables more accurate localisation in z as the ellipticity of the PSF will change more rapidly as the source position does.</p>
  
  <h2 id="MultiColour">Multi Colour Imaging</h2>
  <p>  Finally, the system is capable, in its base form, of 2 channel super-resolution imaging. This is achieved by its 4 lasers (405nm, 488nm, 561nm, 642nm) in the excitation module. This gives two activation and two excitation wavelengths allowing for 2 photoactivatable fluorophores to be imaged concurrently or, of course, 4 standard fluorophores if you can find an experiment that will work for that.</p>

  <h1 id="Structure">Structure</h1><hr>
  <p>The LifeHack System is organised into 3 main modules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Excitation module:</b> Contains the the lasers and AOTF / Shutter for exposure control.</li>
    <li><b>Beam Expansion module:</b> Raises the excitation beam to the correct height for the back port of the microscope and uses a negative/positive lens pair to expand the beam diameter.</li>
    <li><b>Main Body:</b> Includes the necessary structure for the optical paths, sample stage and camera for imaging. This includes components to allow for ring TIRF and IR based autofocus systems. </li>
  </ul>
  <img src="Images/Module-Structure.jpg" width="90%">
  <p>The microscope also includes two sub-modules that are associated with the <b>Main Body</b> of the system but can be encorporated separately into another system to add functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Incubation Box:</b> A custom acryllic box enclosing the main body. Includes large hatches for easy sample and hardware manipulation.</li>
    <li><b>Focus Shifter:</b> Normally encompassed by the main body but effective with any system. Extends the working range of reflection based autofocus systems using a translatable tube lens.</li>
  </ul>
